This acts as a host or controller on the device.  That client app connects to your TiShadow server which pushes your Titanium project source code and resources out to the device and runs it as if it was compiled into the client app.</p><p><img alt="" title="TiShadow" border="0" src="./images/consoles.png"/></p><p>This plugin does a very good job on making the creation e installation as easy as possible to avoid using the OS terminals (consoles) at all. For instance, to run the TiShadow server and run the tests without using this plugin it's necessary to open 2 terminals. In this way, the user can use all the features the TiShadow provides in a transparent way.</p><p><img alt="" title="TiShadow" border="0" src="./images/tishadowToolbar.png"/></p><p>Using all the capabilities Eclipse provides, like wizards, shortcuts, among others,  it is possible to create a TiShadow base application, appify an existing Titanium project, deploy new changes on the application code and one of the best features: the abitily to run tests and see the reports on junit format.</p><p><a href="http://tishadow.yydigital.com/getting%20started" title="TiShadow official page by YYDigital">More about TiShadow</a></p><hr/><h1 id="InstallationGuide">Installation Guide</h1><h2 id="AddingURLrepository">Adding URL repository</h2><p>Point the following URL to your eclipse update site manager to install TiShadow Plugin:</p><p>Eclipse/Titanium Studio:</p><pre><code>http://gzunino.github.io/tishadow-eclipse-plugin/p2/</code></pre><h2 id="Problems">Problems?</h2><p>If you get an error installing similar to this:</p><pre><code>Cannot complete the install because one or more required items could not be found.
