h1{color:blue}. Running Tests with TiShadow

h2. Appify your project

p. First you have to "appify" the project you want to test, which will create a new app that is basically the same but with the TiShadow libraries included.

# Go to New.. TiShadow.. TiShadow Appify Creation (Or, right click on the project > New > TiShadow Appify)
# Enter the name of the appified project and select location of the  project you want to test (base project).
# Select the location where the appified app will be created (output folder) if you don't want the default location.
# Enter the port and host in which the TiShadow server will run.
# Click Finish.

h2. Run the appified project

After that, you need to run the appified project on a device or emulator the same way you would run the original project.

Example: On Genymotion (emulator):
# Open Genymotion.
# Start your preferred device.
# Start the appified project.

h2. Run the tests

Finally, to run the tests, you need to do the following:

# Right click on the appified project that you just created, Run As.. Run TiShadow Tests.
